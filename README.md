# The Most Useful Probability Distributions for Marketing Analytics
# By: Joe Domaleski

Sample R scripts that demonstrate common probability distributions in marketing. For more information, refer to my blog post on Marketing Data Science. Here's a list of the R scripts featured. Each script also creates a plot, which I've saved in the repository as well.

1.	Normal Distribution (Continuous) - normal-distribution.R
2.	Binomial Distribution (Discrete) - binomial-distribution.R
3.	Poisson Distribution (Discrete) - poisson-distribution.R
4.	Exponential Distribution (Continuous) - exponential-distribution.R
5.	Log-Normal Distribution (Continuous) - log-normal-distribution.R
6.	Negative Binomial Distribution (Discrete) - negative-binomial-distribution.R
7.	Beta Distribution (Continuous) - beta-distribution.R
8.	Pareto Distribution (Continuous) - pareto-distribution.R
